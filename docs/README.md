# Rice Leaf Blast Disease Detection with Ro-YOLOv8-PKI

This repository contains a YOLOv8-based model for detecting rice leaf blast disease in agricultural fields. The model is trained to detect the diseaseâ€™s symptoms on rice leaves, providing an efficient way for early diagnosis and crop protection.

## Example Code

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Load pre-trained YOLOv8 model
    model = YOLO('runs/obb/n/Ro-YOLOv8-PKI/weights/best.pt')
    
    # Make predictions on the input image and save results
    results = model.predict('ultralytics/assets/test.jpg', save=True, line_width=6)
